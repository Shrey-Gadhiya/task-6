🛠 Tools Used
PasswordMeter.com

NordPass Password Strength Checker

Kaspersky Password Checker

Browser + Notepad

📌 Steps Followed
Created 5 different passwords with varying:

Lengths

Uppercase and lowercase letters

Tested them using multiple online password strength tools.

Recorded each tool's feedback, including score and time-to-crack.

Noted password tips and best practices.

Researched common attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.

📊 Password Strength Test Summary
Password	Strength	Time to Crack	Notes
hello123	Weak	< 1 second	Too short, no symbols, dictionary word
Hello@123	Medium	~1 hour	Better, but still guessable
H3l!o@2025	Strong	3 years	Good use of symbols and numbers
#F$7g!1zQ@89	Very Strong	100+ years	Excellent complexity and randomness
PurpleBanana$123	Strong	10 years	Passphrase style, long and memorable

🔐 Best Practices for Strong Passwords
Use 12+ characters

Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Avoid using personal information or dictionary words

Prefer passphrases (e.g., "BlueCar$DrivesFast2025")

Use a password manager to store complex passwords

☠️ Common Password Attacks
Brute Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations.

Dictionary Attack: Uses known words and common password lists.

Phishing: Tricks users into revealing their passwords.

Keylogging: Malicious software records keystrokes.

🤖 How Complexity Helps
The more complex a password (length + character variety), the longer it takes to crack, exponentially increasing security. For example, an 8-character password can be cracked in seconds, but a 14-character one could take centuries.
